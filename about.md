This page is dedicated to all of my video game and software development thoughts and endeavors. I hope to update it frequently to help share my work with the world.

I'm the founder, programmer, designer, and CEO of [JB Gaming](https://jbgamedev.com), a small indie game development startup in Omaha, NE.


My latest video game release is [Grave Danger Website](http://www.gravedangergame.com), a puzzle-platformer game inspired by The Lost Vikings. It's [now available on Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/555720)!
